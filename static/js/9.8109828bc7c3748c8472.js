By adopting a policy of event-triggered, and quantized state signal takes a value from a finite subset.\nIn addition, the quantized signal is sent to the sliding mode controller to generate the control signal and realize the\nstabilization of the neural network. we firstly investigate two important parameters of quantization, such as quantified\nsufficient parameter and the maximum value of the parameter that trigger the event. Then by designing a dynamical\nsensitivity parameter which can adjust itself by the system state and event-triggered mechanism, we draw a conclusion\nthat the switching surface is reachable.
