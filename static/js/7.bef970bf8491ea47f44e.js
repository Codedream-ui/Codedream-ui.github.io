Therefore, it is significant to be clear where\nand what propaganda techniques are used in the news for people to understand its theme efficiently during our daily\nlives. Recently some relevant researches are proposed for propaganda detection but unsatisfactory. As a result, detection\nof propaganda techniques in news articles is badly in need of research. In this paper, we are going to introduce our\nsystems for detection of propaganda techniques in news articles, which is split into two tasks, Span Identification (SI)\nand Technique Classification (TC). For these two tasks, we designed a system based on the popular pretrained BERT\nmodel respectively. Experiments on the dataset of about 550 news articles offered by SEMEVAL show that our systems\nperform state-of-the-art.\n            ")])]),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"keywords"},[n("h3",[e._v("Keywords")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("Propaganda detection, neural network, span identification, technique classification, bert.")])])])}]};var s=n("VU/8")({name:"articalDetails_02",components:{},data:function(){return{}}},i,!1,function(e){n("rF/q")},"data-v-80be8f8e",null);t.default=s.exports},"rF/q":function(e,t){}});
