In the network,\na series of convolution operations are used to extract features\nthat can be further processed by a fully-connected layer. Despite\nthe great advantages of the convolution process, its operation is\nnot user-friendly enough to be directly implemented by using\nmemristors. In common practice, a memristor array is utilized\nas the accelerator, which enhances the parallelism of the convolution computation but meanwhile increases the computational\ncomplexity. In this paper, a memristor-based in-situ convolution\ncircuit is proposed with a kernel-priority convolution algorithm.\nThe convolution results are as good as the results generated\nby professional software. The proposed circuit achieves a great\nparallelism in performing convolution operations. The total computing cycles are reduced by more than 80% compared with the\nstate-of-the-art in-situ convolution accelerators. Moreover, fewer\nmemristors are needed and lower computational complexity are\nachieved. The new design has a great potential in implementing\nmore efficient in-situ convolution neural networks.\n            ")])]),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"keywords"},[n("h3",[e._v("Keywords")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("Memristor, convolution operation, neural network, parallel algorithm")])])])}]};var a=n("VU/8")({name:"articalDetails_03",components:{},data:function(){return{}}},o,!1,function(e){n("c38U")},"data-v-3ed823dd",null);t.default=a.exports},c38U:function(e,t){}});
