First, by designing two different types of controllers, we can\nuse them to investigate the exponential anti-synchronization problem for the proposed\nsystems. Secondly, via adopting Lyapunov functional method, the drive-response theory\nand some inequality techniques, several sufficient conditions are derived to ensure the\nglobal exponential anti-synchronization problems of the proposed reaction-diffusion\nMNNs with leakage term and time-varying delays. Specifically, the delays could be\ntime-varying delays or constants in the leakage term. Compared with the previously\nresearch results, the proposed neural network models herein are more general, and\nthe obtained results consider the diffusion effects, leakage delays and time-varying\ndelays, and those results can improve and the previously obtained results. At last, two\nnumerical examples are provided to demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the\nproposed theoretical results.\n            ")])]),e._v(" "),n("div",{staticClass:"keywords"},[n("h3",[e._v("Keywords")]),e._v(" "),n("p",[e._v("Memristive neural networks 路 exponential anti-synchronization 路 leakage\nterm 路 time-varying delays 路 reaction-diffusion terms.")])])])}]};var s=n("VU/8")({name:"articalDetails_04",components:{},data:function(){return{}}},a,!1,function(e){n("YcQx")},"data-v-0eba8765",null);t.default=s.exports}});
